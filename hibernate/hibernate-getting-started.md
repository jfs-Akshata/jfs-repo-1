# What is hibernate?
ORM = Object Relational Mapping
Maps Java Objects to Database Tables

# What are the pain points in JDBC
1. database dependent queries
2. handle numerous checked exceptions
3. redundant boiler plate
4. error-prone due to front-end data types and back end datatypes
5. queries are hard coded, tough to construct
# Advantages of hibernate
1. logic independent of database
2. handle lesser exceptions related to database
3. compact code
4. hibernate maps datatypes of the front end to compatible types in the backend
5. query java objects instead of writing sql queries
6. OOPS : Inheritance relationships are meapped easily
